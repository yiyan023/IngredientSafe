# IngredientSafe 🍎

## Inspiration ✨
Poor vision can jeopardize the health of those who have severe & life-threatening allergies. Whether it's the trouble of ingredient lists or misinterpreting food labels, IngredientSafe hopes to help aging eyes and the visually-impaired stay safe from allergens & dietary restrictions!

## What does this app do? ⁉️
By enabling users to upload images & input their dietary restructions, IngredientSafe can scan food labels & return potential allergens back to the user.

## How does it Work? 👩‍💻
- Initially, the user is directed to a landing page that enables them to upload an image & input their dietary restrictions using JavaScript, HTML & CSS styling

- The images were then converted into text using Pytesseract and OpenCV, in which certain keywords were extracted to determine whether there are potential health risks, which is sent back to the user through the frontend
